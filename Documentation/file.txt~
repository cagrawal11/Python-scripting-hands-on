open file:

f = open('filename', 'r')
 -- filename: full path of the file. can be stored in string and pass as arg to open()
 -- 'r': mode to open file. 'r' is just read, 'w' for write it truncates file everytime the same file is opened.

f is now file object sort of handler. may ops can now be performed using this handler.
1. read file
	f.read()
	this will read the whole file.
	
	To iterate throught the file, line-by-line or word-by-word
		a. while not eof:
			do_something
	
	To loop over line by line:
		with open('filename') as openfileobject: #f
    		for line in openfileobject: #f
       			 do_something()
		File objects are iterable and yield lines until EOF. Using the file object as an iterable uses a buffer to ensure performant reads.
		The file will be automatically closed at the end of the above code (the with construct takes care of that).
		
		Finally, it is worth noting that line will preserve the trailing newline. This can be easily removed using:	
			line = line.rstrip()
	One more way:
		line = f.readline()
